        <br>
        <p>Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective 
        lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that 
        comes first when ordered alphabetically.
         The STATION table is described as follows</p>
         <br>

         <br>
         <br>
        <h4><b>Solution</b></h4>
        <br>
         <h3> SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1   
UNION  
SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1;</h3>
