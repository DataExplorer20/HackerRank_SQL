Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

1>  Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
2>  Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2  sides of equal length.
3>  Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
4>  Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:




Solution:----




select case when A+B <= C or A+C <= B or B+C<=A then 'Not A Triangle'
when A=B and B=C then 'Equilateral'
when A=B or B=C or A=C then 'Isosceles'
else 'Scalene'
end as triangle_type from Triangles;
