Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 A>  happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 B>  happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 C>  happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 D>  happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:






Solution:--------







select round(abs(max(LAT_N)-min(LAT_N)) + abs(max(LONG_W)-min(LONG_W)),4) from station;
